# Contributing

Follow these steps to contribute to the project.

## Repo Setup

Clone this repo to your local machine and install the dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

**NOTE**: The package manager used to install and link dependencies must be **pnpm**.

## Pull Request

- Checkout a topic branch from a base branch, e.g. main, and merge back against that branch.
- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.
- To check that your contributions match the project coding style make sure `pnpm run lint:fix` && `pnpm run format:fix` passes. To build project run: `pnpm run build`.
- Commit messages in English.
- No need to worry about code style as long as you have installed the dev dependencies - modified files are automatically checked for linting issues and formatted with Prettier on commit (by invoking [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) via [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)).
